# Deploying a machine learning model to predict employee attrition


The value of employees to an organization is a very crucial element in the success of the organization. 
            When employees leave an organization, they carry with them invaluable knowledge which is often the source of competitive 
            advantage for the business. The employee attrition is often unpredictable and can leave gaps in an organization. 
            If organizations know why their employees leave, they can develop effective strategies for employee retention. 
            
            The model below will help your organization predict employee attrition. This model was created by Susan Qi Sun and trained by using IBM HR data.
            Logistics Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Bagging Ensemble models were constructed and evaluated to 
            predict employee attrition. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to maximize model performance. 
            The Random Forest model with hyperparameter tuning is the final best model, which was then deployed with Flask on Heroku.
